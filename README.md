# things-that-might-be-up-in-the-future
idk maybe something will eventually be posted on here  but idk at this point
i mean my account will probably not be used for posing any code, manely just commenting and the occasional really basic program.
i mean the most I've done is try to learn javascript and then become not interested and switch staright to music so I mean in the future you could  be getting a midi player/maker but don't count on it alright?
ty thanks for viewing
tho im only 10
